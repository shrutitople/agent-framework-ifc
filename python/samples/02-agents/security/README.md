# FIDES security samples

This folder contains runnable FIDES samples. Keep this README as the quick
entry point for choosing and running a sample; use
[FIDES_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](FIDES_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for the architecture,
security model, middleware behavior, and API reference.

## What each sample demonstrates

| Sample | Focus | Demonstrates |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| `email_security_example.py` | Prompt injection defense | `SecureAgentConfig`, Foundry-backed email handling, `quarantined_llm`, and approval on policy violations |
| `repo_confidentiality_example.py` | Data exfiltration prevention | Confidentiality labels, Foundry-backed repository access, `max_allowed_confidentiality`, and approval before leaking private data |
| `github_mcp_example.py` | Remote MCP URL with local FIDES enforcement | `SecureMCPToolProxy(url=...)`, direct GitHub MCP access, tool auto-labeling, and post-tool-call policy enforcement |
| `playwright_mcp_example.py` | Local stdio MCP server with browser automation | `SecureMCPToolProxy(MCPStdioTool(...))`, Playwright browser control, untrusted web-page labeling, and auto-hiding of page snapshots |

## Prerequisites

Run these samples from the `python/` directory with the repo development
environment available.

- Azure CLI authentication: `az login`
- `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` set in your environment
- `FOUNDRY_MODEL` set in your environment for the main agent deployment
- Local dev environment installed (for example, `uv sync --dev`)

These samples use Azure OpenAI for the main agent and keep the quarantine
client pinned to `gpt-4o-mini` where applicable.

For `github_mcp_example.py`, set:

- `GITHUB_PAT` (GitHub Personal Access Token)
- `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` (Foundry project endpoint)
- `FOUNDRY_MODEL` (optional model override)

## Suppressing the experimental warning

The FIDES APIs in these samples are still experimental. Each sample includes a
short commented `warnings.filterwarnings(...)` snippet near the imports.
Uncomment it if you want to suppress the FIDES warning before using the
experimental APIs locally.

## Running the samples

### `email_security_example.py`

This sample simulates an inbox containing trusted and untrusted emails,
including prompt-injection attempts that try to force a privileged `send_email`
tool call.

Run it with:

```bash
uv run samples/02-agents/security/email_security_example.py --cli
uv run samples/02-agents/security/email_security_example.py --devui
uv run samples/02-agents/security/email_security_example.py --cli --debug
```

When you run the DevUI variant, the sample prints the active DevUI bearer token
before starting the server.

Add `--debug` to enable verbose tool and security middleware logging.

What to look for:

- Untrusted email bodies are handled through the FIDES security flow
- `quarantined_llm` processes hidden content in isolation
- DevUI requests approval if the agent tries a blocked privileged action

### `repo_confidentiality_example.py`

This sample simulates a public issue that tries to trick the agent into reading
private repository secrets and posting them to a public channel.

Run it with:

```bash
uv run samples/02-agents/security/repo_confidentiality_example.py --cli
uv run samples/02-agents/security/repo_confidentiality_example.py --devui
```

When you run the DevUI variant, the sample prints the active DevUI bearer token
before starting the server.

What to look for:

- Reading public content keeps the context public
- Reading private content taints the context as private
- Posting private data to a public destination triggers an approval request

### `github_mcp_example.py`

This sample connects directly to `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/insiders` through
`MCPStreamableHTTPTool`, then wraps the MCP client in `SecureMCPToolProxy` so
FIDES middleware can inspect tool results and enforce policy locally. The github
MCP with /insiders endpoint is used because it includes security-relevant
 annotations in the tool metadata and results.

Run it with:

```bash
uv run samples/02-agents/security/github_mcp_example.py --cli
uv run samples/02-agents/security/github_mcp_example.py --cli --attack
uv run samples/02-agents/security/github_mcp_example.py --devui
uv run samples/02-agents/security/github_mcp_example.py --devui --debug
```

What to look for:

- MCP tools are auto-labeled from remote annotations
- Untrusted tool output is tracked by FIDES label middleware
- Attack-mode write attempts can trigger policy enforcement or approval

### `playwright_mcp_example.py`

This sample drives a real browser through the official Playwright MCP server
(`npx @playwright/mcp@latest`) running locally as an `MCPStdioTool`, wrapped in
`SecureMCPToolProxy` so FIDES middleware can label and enforce policy on every
browser tool result. The demo task opens the Amazon UK home page and searches for
"shoes". Web pages are untrusted by nature, making this a realistic
prompt-injection setting: page snapshots are labeled UNTRUSTED and hidden behind
variable references.

Extra prerequisite: Node.js on PATH. The first run downloads `@playwright/mcp`.
Install the Chromium build the MCP server expects with its own installer (the
global `playwright` CLI may install a different revision):

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest install-browser chromium
```

Run it with:

```bash
uv run samples/02-agents/security/playwright_mcp_example.py --cli
uv run samples/02-agents/security/playwright_mcp_example.py --cli --headless
uv run samples/02-agents/security/playwright_mcp_example.py --devui
uv run samples/02-agents/security/playwright_mcp_example.py --devui --debug
```

What to look for:

- Playwright tools are auto-labeled on connect by `SecureMCPToolProxy`
- Browser page snapshots taint the context as UNTRUSTED
- Untrusted page content is hidden behind variable references before reaching the agent

## Where to find the details

For the full FIDES design and API details, see
[FIDES_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](FIDES_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md), which covers:

- integrity and confidentiality labels
- label propagation and auto-hiding behavior
- policy enforcement middleware
- security tools such as `quarantined_llm` and `inspect_variable`
- `SecureAgentConfig` and manual integration patterns
